# Multi-Cracker

## Overview
Multi-Cracker is a proof of concept for a distributed password cracker designed to harness the power of collaborative computing using discord as a C2.

## Usage
1. Execute the provided .exe file to initiate the program.
2. Establish a connection with your Discord server, facilitating seamless collaboration.
3. Synchronize data with other bots to optimize resources for efficient password cracking.

## Operation
4. Upon receiving a command, the cracker is ready to receive a list of passwords and a hash.
5. It diligently works through the data, halting all other bots once the correct password is identified.
6. The confirmed password is promptly relayed back to the Discord server, streamlining the cracking process.

## ToDo
- Implement secure encryption protocols for communication.
- Enhance user interface for improved usability.
- Optimize resource utilization for better performance.
- Implement error handling mechanisms for robust operation.
- Add support for different hashing algorithms.
- Conduct thorough testing to identify and resolve potential issues.
- Document installation and setup instructions.
- Explore options for extending platform compatibility.
- Consider implementing a user authentication system.
- Gather user feedback for continuous improvement.


Enhance your password cracking capabilities with Multi-Cracker's collaborative approach, fostering faster results through synchronized efforts.
